# EECE5554_VO

##### Additions by abinav
##### I have added a ROS_VO workspace
##### the workspace has a camera_frame_grabber ros package I created 
##### and also a folder called src/VO_Mono which is not a ros package 
##### You can run the codes inside VO_Mono simply with python3 and also I have created a venv to install project specific packages


```sh

##### To activate the venv--> Go to VO_Mono folder and  run
source myenv/bin/activate
####  To run code use
python3 aa_visual_odometry.py

```
